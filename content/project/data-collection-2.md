## Motivation

The main chunk of work for second term will involve incorporating satellite imagery into the foundational model to allow it to react to cloud coverage.

## 9/1/24

### Action points

* Over Christmas break I worked on accessing the data for satellite imagery
  * This involved numerous calls and e-mails due to the lack of up-to-date documentation

### TODO

* My term 2 gantt chart is still relevant, but I will be ahead of schedule as I did not assume that I would get the satellite imagery over Christmas
* I'll have more time to improve the foundational model, as well as study different ways in collecting the data for the foundational model
* I'll also have more time to develop the model with satellite imagery
* If I remain ahead of schedule I will then look into further improvements to the model
  * Looking at data regarding aerosols
  * Not dealing with live data since this will be a major challenge with little reward for the report
