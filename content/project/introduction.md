# Motivation

This will be my progress diary for CS351-30. It is not intended to be viewed by anyone aside from myself and my project supervisor. As such the notes will mostly be bulleted and little effort will be put into making it look aesthetically pleasing. Instead, the aim of this diary is to keep track of my progress so that I remember what I have done and what I need to do. Moreover this will be where I make notes on things that may become relevant later, and so it will help me deal with future challenges. The website version will be updated in line with the local version to allow my project supervisor to actively check my progress. Each separate blog will correspond to one of the tasks outlined in my Gantt chart. Big milestones (like phases of the model) may be given their own blog and presented in a more thoughtful way to greater demonstrate my work.
