## Introduction

Thank you for stopping by. On this page I intend to keep an updated log of my academic activities.

This will include:

* Any activity regarding my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtMZAr3sYLpx91sQ8De4YbA)
* Completed projects
* LeetCode problems
* Anything else I think could be beneficial for others :)


 
### YouTube

On my YouTube channel I post *potentially helpful* videos for revision. They typically go through question(s) from a specific section within a module.
I intend to continue doing this throughout my time at university, and work on producing content at an increased rate over a larger range of modules.

I may even deviate from this standard format and post videos about any personal projects, although my main goal for now is to make it a solid revision resource for students.

When I post about my YouTube activity I will give it the **youtube** tag, and I may also provide the specific module as well. On the blog post itself I will embed the YouTube video and also provide my digitally handwritten workings and any additional links I think are relevant. 

I have already created a fair few videos prior to creating this website, but I do not have any additional information for them so I will not post them here.


### Completed projects

These will be categorised with the **project** tag. I intend to provide a full rundown of the project which will include:
1. The prerequisites
2. The development of the project
3. The final result
4. My reflection

But first... I need to actually have a personal project worth showing :( Perhaps the website itself would count! 



### LeetCode problems

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a platform that provids thousands of programming challenges that typically arise in technical interviews. 
It is a great resource to practice and improve your programming skills. There are various other websites similar to this (which I'm sure you can find with a simple search)
but I am happy working with LeetCode.

These posts will be created with the **leetcode** tag, and I may also have a more general **challenge** tag for any similar coding/engineering problems I complete that are not projects.

### Other

As this website develops I will likely come up with more categories so stay tuned!
