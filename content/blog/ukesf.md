## Motivation

[UKESF](https://www.ukesf.org/)

## How it started

My journey with UKESF started with an outreach e-mail from my engineering department which introduced the scheme and directed me towards the application process. I did not have any internship plans lined up for the summer, so I was instantly curious about the opportunity and started looking through the options available.

There was a really wide variety of offers available which was positive to see as I did not feel limited in my options.

## Placement vs internship

UKESF offered both summer internships and year long placements, so it is important you consider this while applying. In my experience, I had a placement offer external to UKESF with National Grid, but I still had to choose between the two as there was a timing conflict. I am going to talk about the way in which I reached my decision in the hopes that you will be able to make a more informed decision.

### Placement

Longer duration, get to take a break from uni, but have to go back, higher chance of getting graduate offer since a placement is a larger commitment, still have to pay tuitions?

### Internship

Less of a commitment, doesn't interfere with university timeline.

## My placement

## Scholars workshop

## My advice

There are plenty of resources outlining how to best make use of your internship or placement, so I will not include those general tips here. Instead I will be more specific, and I will also reflect on my own performance.

The first week is an important phase of the time you will spend with your company for a few reasons. If you typically find yourself as more of an introvert like myself, this will be a particularly challenging time as there will likely be many conversations to be had with your new colleagues. It is important to show up for yourself and really try to engage in these conversations, even if you would feel more comfortable sat in the corner instead. Some of the conversation will stray from work life too, and so it is important to recognise when you can be more informal and personal to build up these new relationships right from the start. As your time with the company progresses, it will get harder and harder to open up if you did not do it within the first few days since you will get accustomed to not getting involved and it will feel like a larger hurdle to ignite the conversation. At the end of the day, regardless of a person's position or age, they are still just a person. It is important to remember that so that you can engage in conversation more fluidly.

When it comes to work, it is valuable to ensure you understand the task properly before you start. It is okay to say if you do not fully understand what is being asked of you, because in the long run it will save so much time and you will be much more productive. If you manager proceeds to give you a huge list of tasks, I would also suggest asking about the priorities of tasks so that you know what to focus on. Moreover, it is important to "manage you manager" so that you do not end up with an impossible workload that they expect you to complete. Instead, if you recognise you might have too large of a workload you should state this earlier on so that the manager understands your position and limits. In my experience I would ask how long certain tasks were expected to take and then communicate my initial plan on how I would intend to go about the task.
