## Motivation

I wanted to review my first year to hopefully help out any newcomers to the University of Warwick who happen to find my website. 
I'm going to go through each module individually, providing:

* An overview
* The main merits of the module
* The main downfalls of the module
* My advice for doing well in it

As a [Computer Systems Engineer](https://warwick.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/compsysengmeng/) I take a mix of modules from both the Computer Science and the Engineering deparments. The course is not particularly popular (there are about 30 of us in my year), but we will hopefully develop a much wider range of skills that employers will value. Our course is often forgetten about and it is likely you will experience timetabling issues if you take this course, but there have not been any major issues yet for me.

### CS118

#### Overview

This is your introduction to programming where you will complete a couple of courseworks to make a robot navigate a maze. At the end of the year you then get to enjoy writing some Java code on paper as fast as humanly possible. See the [module webpage](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/modules/cs118/) for more details.

#### Merits

* <span style="color:green">The coursework is very visual and hence rewarding (when it works)</span>
* <span style="color:green">The guide for the coursework is very expansive but also very informative - read the guide!</span>
* <span style="color:green">The first coursework is easy, even for people with minimal programming experience</span>

#### Downfalls

* <span style="color:red">If you have not programmed before, do not think this module is going to make you a good programmer</span>
* <span style="color:red">The exam is notoriously rushed for time, their reasoning being that it would be too easy otherwise</span>

#### My advice

If you are lucky enough to be reading this before starting CS118, then **learn Java**. This can be done through YouTube tutorials or online courses, just make sure you understand all the basics of coding (selection statements, conditional statement, loops, and functions). Then to prepare even more start reseraching and practicing object-oriented programming (OOP).

If you are now in the middle of the coursework panicking that you do not understand much at all (like I was) try to get as much help as you can from both the module organiser as well as fellow students. You get quite a lot of time for each coursework so you can take your time (provided you do not leave it until the last week) and try and actually understand what you are doing and the problems that you are trying to solve.

As said already, you will be rushed massively in the exam. Allegedly 50% of people in my year did not reach the last question (contributing 20 out of the 100 possible marks). As such people will advise you to get through the questions as quickly as possible. Although that is fairly sound advice, it is not very useful for students like myself that do not have years of programming experience before even entering university. This is because it took me a while to even understand what some of the questions were asking for, since I had not yet developed my problem solving skills as much as others. My advice would be to take more time on each question, ensuring you first understand what it is asking for before writing anything. This is basic advice, I know, but it is especially relevant for this paper in my opinion. When you have about 15 minutes left of the exam, then you can try and rush any of the remaining questions you have as some questions may only require a line or two of code for a couple of marks.

In my exam I tried rushing every question, which caused me to panic more when I did not instantly understand what a question wanted. As a result my answer booklet became full of gaps and by the end I was trying to cram everything into places I had not left enough lines for. Although I still did well, the way I approached the exam caused a lot of stress and I would have been much better off if I had taken a second to breathe and then try to answer each question more methodically.

### CS132

#### Overview

Here you are going to learn all about the things that make your computer work (with some C programming on the side). Matthew Leeke was the module organiser of the module for some time, however he has now left so my view of the module may no longer be as relevant. See the [module webpage](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/modules/cs132/) for more details.

#### Merits

* <span style="color:green">Engaging, well-organised (but is dependent on the organiser)</span>
* <span style="color:green">A fair amount of content is repeated from GCSE and A-level computer science</span>

#### Downfalls

* <span style="color:red">The previous module organiser left (they were excellent)</span>
* <span style="color:red">There is a fair amount of content you just have to remember (and diagrams)</span>

#### My advice

Provided the marking stays consistent with a change in organiser, focus on your documentation for your coursework assignments. Even if you have outstanding code, if you do not have the documentation to back it up you will not do nearly as well as you would have thought. Additionally, provided you have really extensive and well-developed documentation, your code does not even have to be anything too amazing. Ideally you practice doing some basic code in C, and from there the courseworks should be a breeze.

For the exam there are lots of past papers available. Go through each of them and do not take any shortcuts with them. From the papers you will see there is quite a bit of consistency, so you can get a really good idea of how your exam will be (note again the module organiser will be changing so that may changes things slightly). Although you do not get a markscheme you should be able to find the answers to all the questions within the lectures (the questions stay true to the content you are taught).

### CS126

#### Overview

It is time for data structures! Here you will learn about various structures and algorithms, and then create your own in Java. Please note my views on this module are highly skewed due to the module organiser. See the [module webpage](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/modules/cs126/) for more details.

#### Merits

* <span style="color:green">There are some really good [books](https://rl.talis.com/3/warwick/lists/695B2B82-D727-7965-F551-20D60D4ECD90.html?lang=en) for this module</span>

#### Downfalls

* <span style="color:red">The teaching and organisation was lackluster</span>
* <span style="color:red">The coursework has been complained about for multiple years now</span>

#### My advice

If you are unlucky enough to get the WAFFLES coursework, start it as early as possible and make use of anything you did in the labs to help you.

For the exam, complete the exercises from the book as there is a high chance you will find an exact replica of the question in your exam. As always, complete all the past papers and cope with the lack of markscheme by talking to as many peers as possible about your solutions.

### CS133

#### Overview

This module is all about the laws and ethics related to computer science. Try not to fall asleep. See the [module webpage](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/modules/cs133/) for more details.

#### Merits

* <span style="color:green">This is the easiest module provided you put in just a bit of effort</span>

#### Downfalls

* <span style="color:red">It is not engaging at all</span>

#### My advice

Although I attended almost every lecture, it was almost completely unnecessary because I would instantly forget everything afterwards. This is because you would get bombarded by about 40 slides of pure text on topics that are not particularly interesting to the majority of people (simply because it is taught in such a draining manner).

For the class test, spend a week or so going through the quiz available to you until you have answered all the questions. It will be slow to start off with since you are unlikely to know any of the answers (even after attending every lecture). There will be questions that are not on the quiz, so if you are motivated enough you can work through all of the slides and create flashcards on any key ideas or terms.

For the presentation, you will get into a small group and will have to present to 10-30 people. We were given some articles to choose from, although I believe some groups were allowed to pick whatever they wanted. You do not have to do too much for this, just make sure you have a well formatted and organised presentation and that everyone contributes (if someone is not contributing feel free to snitch on them).

For the essay, do not leave it until the last day. Similarly you do not really need to do it months in advance either. It took me about a week on and off, it was awful at first but once I got into it there was a slight amount of enjoyment. Think of a topic that is not too broad, find a couple of main resources to ~~steal~~ cite that are from reputable sources. You can then bulk up your bibliogtaphy with a few more websites that give definitions and other small arguments in your essay.

And finally, for the PDP, you really do not have to do much to get full marks (from what I have heard anyway). There are 3 sections, you just need to write a few paragraphs for the first 2 sections. Then for the final section you should come up with 5 detailed goals with evidence of completion. Common goals include: writing a CV, completing an online course, any relevant personal project, attending academic events, working on mental health (like walking, going to the gym), and basically anything else provided you can justify it.
