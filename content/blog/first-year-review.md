## Motivation

I wanted to review my first year to hopefully help out any newcomers to the University of Warwick who happen to find my website. 
I'm going to go through each module individually, providing:

* An overview
* The main merits of the module
* The main downfalls of the module
* My advice for doing well in it

### CS118

#### Overview

This is your introduction to programming where you will complete a couple of courseworks to make a robot navigate a maze. At the end of the year you then get to enjoy writing some Java code on paper as fast as humanly possible. See the [module webpage](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/modules/cs118/) for more in-depth details.

#### Merits

* <span style="color:green">The coursework is very visual and hence rewarding (when it works)</span>
* <span style="color:green">The guide for the coursework is very expansive but also very informative - read the guide!</span>
* <span style="color:green">The first coursework is easy, even for people with minimal programming experience</span>

#### Downfalls

* <span style="color:red">If you have not programmed before, do not think this module is going to make you a good programmer</span>
* <span style="color:red">The exam is notoriously rushed for time, their reasoning being that it would be too easy otherwise</span>

#### My advice

If you are lucky enough to be reading this before starting CS118, then **learn Java**. This can be done through YouTube tutorials or online courses, just make sure you understand all the basics of coding (selection statements, conditional statement, loops, and functions). Then to prepare even more start reseraching and practicing object-oriented programming (OOP).

If you are now in the middle of the coursework panicking that you do not understand much at all (like I was) try to get as much help as you can from both the module organiser as well as fellow students. You get quite a lot of time for each coursework so you can take your time (provided you do not leave it until the last week) and try and actually understand what you are doing and the problems that you are trying to solve.

As said already, you will be rushed massively in the exam. Allegedly 50% of people in my year did not reach the last question (contributing 20 out of the 100 possible marks). As such people will advise you to get through the questions as quickly as possible. Although that is fairly sound advice, it is not very useful for students like myself that do not have years of programming experience before even entering university. This is because it took me a while to even understand what some of the questions were asking for, since I had not yet developed my problem solving skills as much as others. My advice would be to take more time on each question, ensuring you first understand what it is asking for before writing anything. This is basic advice, I know, but it is especially relevant for this paper in my opinion. When you have about 15 minutes left of the exam, then you can try and rush any of the remaining questions you have as some questions may only require a line or two of code for a couple of marks.

In my exam I tried rushing every question, which caused me to panic more when I did not instantly understand what a question wanted. As a result my answer booklet became full of gaps and by the end I was trying to cram everything into places I had not left enough lines for. Although I still did well, the way I approached the exam caused a lot of stress and I would have been much better off if I had taken a second to breathe and then try to answer each question more methodically.

### CS132

#### Overview

Here you are going to learn all about the things that make your computer work (with some C programming on the side). Matthew Leeke was the module organiser of the module for some time, however he has now left so my view of the module may no longer be as relevant. See the [module webpage](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/modules/cs132/) for more in-depth details.

#### Merits

* <span style="color:green">Engaging, well-organised (but is dependent on the organiser)</span>

#### Downfalls

* <span style="color:red">The previous module organiser left (they were excellent)</span>
* <span style="color:red">There is a fair amount of content you just have to remember (and diagrams)</span>

#### My advice

Provided the marking stays consistent with a change in organiser, focus on your documentation for your coursework assignments. Even if you have outstanding code, if you do not have the documentation to back it up you will not do nearly as well as you would have thought. Additionally, provided you have really extensive and well-developed documentation, your code does not even have to be anything too amazing. Ideally you practice doing some basic code in C, and from there the courseworks should be a breeze.
