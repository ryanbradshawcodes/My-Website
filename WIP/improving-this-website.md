## Motivation

As the creation of this website was largely just utilising an existing template, I wanted to make some changes of my own. This is so I can improve my understanding of how this website works and also make the website more personalised and adjusted to my liking.

This running log will be split into two sections: **Graphical** improvements and **Functional** improvements

## Graphical

Resizing of text.

## Functional

Added the tags below each blog title. This makes the topic of the blog clearer.
