## Motivation

I was looking on the Warwick website and I started searching through the list of staff in the engineering department. Upon clicking on one of their profiles I noticed a section called 'Research Interests'. This gave me the idea of trying to find staff members based off their research interests such that I can more easily find and talk to experts in fields that I am interested in pursuing.

## Development

First searched general web scraping
